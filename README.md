# Finite-State-Machine Visualizer

Welcome to the Finite State Machine (FSM) Visualizer, a powerful tool designed to simplify the understanding and analysis of finite state machines. Whether you're a software developer, system designer, or a student learning about state machines, this visualizer provides an intuitive interface to comprehend and analyze your FSM models.



## Roadmap

- [X] transitions can be assigned names

- [ ] states can be assigned names

- [X] implement buffered rendering for a smoother experience with larger FSMs

- [ ] saving and loading FSMs from file

- [ ] undo / redo feature

- [ ] simulation mode: allows the user to test a FSM with given inputs (visual representation of steps?)

- [ ] zoom feature in the editor + zoom-to-fit feature

- [ ] error highlighting and correction: check if a FSM is complete (differentiate between different FSM types) and maybe try to add missing states or transitions

- [ ] documentation generator: automatically generates a documentation for the structure and behavior of the FSM

- [ ] allow for colorcoding of states and transitions (also allows grouping)

- [ ] export FSM as image/svg

- [ ] allow for easy state resizing

- [ ] Multi-Select and Bulk Actions: Selection of multiple states or multiple transitions
